# PDO Sqlite driver for MDB2

It's experimental driver and was used only to test SQLite3 workability for [Poweradmin](https://www.poweradmin.org) project. Tests showed that it is incompleate and has some issues.

After all last stable MDB2 release was made in 2007 (beta version in 2010). PDO is more mature technology and officialy supported.

The source code was taken from [metala.org](http://downloads.metala.org/pear/MDB2/MDB2_Driver_pdoSqlite.tar.bz2).
